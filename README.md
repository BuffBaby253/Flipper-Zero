# Files For Flipper By Me

![pli](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27365f73-1883-4e91-87d1-40d7afae322d)

I like to think of the Flipper Zero as the Multi-Tool of electronics

The Flipper is an open source tomagotchi device that is capable of many tasks, like NFC, RFID, Sub-Ghz, Infared & more

Being open source there are a couple custom firmwares availible and many people like myself contribute to make tools & scripts as well as upload files for it
